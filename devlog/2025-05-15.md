## Airport City Search API: Unified Either-Based Endpoint

### Summary of Work

- Refactored the `AirportCitySearchClient` and `AmadeusContext` to use a single endpoint for both search and lookup-by-ID operations, leveraging `Either<AirportCitySearchFilter, LocationId>` as the input and `Either<Location, AirportCitySearchResponse>` as the successful result.
- Ensured the implementation is fully aligned with the OpenAPI spec, providing 100% coverage for both `/locations` and `/locations/{locationId}` endpoints.
- The new pattern allows consumers to pass either a filter or a location ID directly to the endpoint, with seamless, type-safe handling of both use cases.
- Updated the API context to expose the new endpoint, and reviewed usage patterns for clarity and maintainability.
- Discussed and confirmed that LanguageExt’s implicit conversions allow for clean, ergonomic usage—no explicit `Either` construction or helpers required.

### Example Usage

```csharp
// Example: Search by filter
var filter = new AirportCitySearchFilter(
    SubType: [LocationSubType.Airport],
    Keyword: "New York",
    CountryCode: Option<string>.Some("US"),
    PageLimit: Option<int>.None,
    PageOffset: Option<int>.None,
    Sort: Option<SortType>.None,
    View: Option<ViewType>.None
);

var result = await context.AirportCities
    .FilterBy(() => filter)
    .ExecuteReaderAsync(CancellationToken.None);

result.Match(
    Left: error => {
        // Handle ErrorResponse (API/network error)
    },
    Right: success => success.Match(
        Left: response => {
            // Handle AirportCitySearchResponse (search results)
        },
        Right: location => {
            // Handle Location (single result by ID)
        }
    )
);

// Example: Lookup by LocationId
var locationId = new LocationId("JFK");

var resultById = await context.AirportCities
    .FilterBy(() => locationId)
    .ExecuteReaderAsync(CancellationToken.None);

resultById.Match(
    Left: error => {
        // Handle ErrorResponse
    },
    Right: success => success.Match(
        Left: response => {
            // Handle AirportCitySearchResponse (should not happen for ID lookup)
        },
        Right: location => {
            // Handle Location (single result by ID)
        }
    )
);
```

### Notes

- This approach keeps the API surface unified, type-safe, and easy to use for both search and direct lookup scenarios.
- The pattern is extensible for future query types and fits well with LanguageExt and functional programming idioms.
- All work is in accordance with the project’s requirement for 100% OpenAPI spec coverage and dev log documentation.

**Next Steps:**  
- Expand unit/integration tests to cover both branches of the new endpoint.
- Document the pattern for other API clients as a recommended approach.
