# Dev Log â€” 2025-05-14

## Summary
- Started a development log system in the `devlog` folder at the solution root.
- Created `ClientImplementationInstructions.md` with a detailed guide for implementing new OpenAPI specs.
- Updated the implementation pattern to use .NET nullable types (e.g., `string?`, `int?`) for optional fields in API models instead of `Option<T>`.
- Reviewed `ApiContext`, `AirlineCodeLookup`, and `FlightInspiration` namespaces for architectural patterns.
- Provided a summary table and example skeleton for future endpoint/client implementations.

Future entries will be added daily to this folder, each file named by date (`yyyy-mm-dd.md`).
