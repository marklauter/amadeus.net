### Updates & Progress

- **Documentation (`EndpointClientImplementationInstructions.md`):**
  - Refreshed the client endpoint implementation guide to reflect recent refactoring in `AmadeusContext` and client classes.
  - Key changes include:
    - Updated `AmadeusContext` description: Endpoints are now initialized via static factory methods in client classes (e.g., `YourFeatureClient.CreateEndpoint(...)`) rather than `Lazy<T>`.
    - Revised Step 3 ("Define Client Factory and Register Endpoint in `AmadeusContext`"): Details creating a dedicated client class (e.g., `YourFeatureClient`) with static `CreateEndpoint` methods (using `Endpoint.Create<Q,R>` or custom delegates) and registering these in `AmadeusContext` via direct property initialization using its primary constructor parameters.
    - Updated the "Minimal Concrete Example" to showcase the new pattern with an example `MyFeatureClient` and its usage in `AmadeusContext`.
  - This ensures the guide accurately represents the current, streamlined approach for adding new API client endpoints.
  - Further refined "Step 1. Define Models" to explicitly state:
    - The OpenAPI specification is the definitive source for all DTOs.
    - Response models should be placed in a `Response` subfolder (e.g., `Clients/YourFeatureName/Response/`) with a corresponding namespace (e.g., `Amadeus.Net.Clients.YourFeatureName.Response`).
    - Developers must check the shared `Amadeus.Net.Clients.Response` namespace for reusable models (like `ApiError`, `Meta`, etc.) before creating new ones to avoid duplication.
    - Corrected "Step 2. Define Query Object" and the "Minimal Concrete Example" to reflect that `ToParams()` now returns `Seq<QueryParameter>` (using `QueryParameter.Create`) instead of `Seq<KeyValuePair<string, string>>`.

- **Manual Documentation Tweaks (`EndpointClientImplementationInstructions.md`):**
  - In "Core Patterns": Changed `AmadeusContext` to `Context.AmadeusContext` for full qualification.
  - In the minimal example's xUnit test (`MyFeatureTests`):
    - Modified the `release` lambda in `Prelude.use` from `sp => { if (sp is IDisposable d) d.Dispose(); return Prelude.unit; }` to `provider => provider.Dispose()`.
    - Changed `context.MyFeatureEndpoint.GetFn(...)` to `context.MyFeatureEndpoint.Get(...)`.
    - Simplified the `Assert.Fail` message in the error case from `error.Title} - {error.Detail}` to just `{error}`.
  - Removed a redundant commented-out property definition line from the `AmadeusContext.cs` snippet in the "Minimal Concrete Example" as it was already covered in the broader class structure example.
  - In the "Minimal Concrete Example", uncommented the `AmadeusContext.cs` snippet and revised its preceding comments to clarify it's an illustrative example of how to integrate a new endpoint into an existing `AmadeusContext` file, rather than a new file to be created.

### Continued Documentation Updates (Endpoints Refactoring)

**Objective:** Complete the update of `EndpointClientImplementationInstructions.md` to reflect major codebase refactoring from `Clients` to `Endpoints` and `ApiContext` to `Context`.

**Summary of Changes:**

1.  **`EndpointClientImplementationInstructions.md` Fully Updated (Automated Pass):**
    *   Completed a comprehensive update of the documentation to align with the new namespace and directory structure (`Amadeus.Net.Endpoints`, `Amadeus.Net.Context`).
    *   Changed terminology from "Client" (e.g., `YourFeatureClient`) to refer to endpoint logic classes more directly by feature name (e.g., `YourFeature`).
    *   Updated all file paths, namespaces, and `using` directives in the core pattern descriptions and the minimal concrete C# example.
    *   Ensured the minimal example for query, response, endpoint logic, `AmadeusContext` registration, and xUnit tests accurately reflects the new structure (e.g., `Amadeus.Net.Endpoints.MyFeature`, `Amadeus.Net.Endpoints.MyFeature.Response`, `Amadeus.Net.Context.AmadeusContext`).
    *   Corrected shared model paths and namespaces (e.g., `Amadeus.Net.Endpoints.Response` for `ApiError`).
    *   Updated references to `IQuery` and `QueryParameter` to their new location in `Amadeus.Net.Endpoints.Query`.
    *   The test example was refined to use more consistent naming and DI practices, including configuration for `ClientMetaData`.

**Next Steps:**

*   Review the updated documentation for any final polish or clarity improvements.
*   Await further tasks from the USER.
